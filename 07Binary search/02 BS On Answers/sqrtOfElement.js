//Optimal Approach(Using binary search): 
//We are going to use the Binary Search algorithm to optimize the approach.

//The primary objective of the Binary Search algorithm is to efficiently determine the appropriate half to eliminate, thereby reducing the search space by half. 
//It does this by determining a specific condition that ensures that the target is not present in that half.

//Now, we are not given any sorted array on which we can apply binary search. 
//But, if we observe closely, we can notice that our answer space i.e. [1, n] is sorted. 
//So, we will apply binary search on the answer space.
